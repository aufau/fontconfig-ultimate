patches as found in main portage tree they provide a powerfull and
unique font rendering system for linux.

Besides a set of rendering rules fontconfig-infinality-ultimate
contains two predefined font replacement tables covering widely used
and de facto "standard" font families in digital world:

  propertiary font families

  package and other propertiary fonts.
